# odin-recipes

This website is my first HTML project with Odin

It will consist of an Index page and some links to different recipes
At the end of the project, I will demonstrate my knowledge of HTML basics and practice it even further.
The project will include working with Lists, Links, Images, paragraphs and plain text with some extra tags (e.g. strong/em)
