    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This tiramisu recipe is relatively long and complex, but the ending result is 100% worth it!</p>
    <p>This tiramisu recipe shows you how to make the <em>classic</em> Italian layered dessert at home with
        rum-flavored, coffee-soaked ladyfingers, a creamy mascarpone custard, and whipped cream.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pound mascarpone cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>¼ cup strong brewed coffee, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rum</li>
        <li>2 (3 ounce) packages ladyfinger cookies</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together egg yolks and sugar in a medium saucepan until well blended. Whisk in milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil.</li>
        <li>Boil gently for 1 minute, then remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Cover tightly and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Beat cream and vanilla in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>Remove egg yolk mixture from the refrigerator; add mascarpone cheese and whisk until smooth.</li>
        <li>Combine coffee and rum in a small bowl. Split ladyfingers in half lengthwise and drizzle with the coffee mixture.</li>
        <li>Arrange 1/2 of the soaked ladyfingers in the bottom of a 7x11-inch dish. Spread 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers,
            then spread 1/2 of the whipped cream over top. Repeat layers once more. Sprinkle cocoa powder over top.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate until set, 4 to 6 hours.</li>
    </ol>
